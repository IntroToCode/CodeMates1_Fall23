English Breakfast

## Servings: 
4

## Time to prepare: 
30 minutes

## Ingredients:
8 sausages (preferably Cumberland or Lincolnshire)
8 rashers of bacon
4 black puddings, sliced
4 large eggs
4 large tomatoes, halved
1 cup of button mushrooms, cleaned
1 can of baked beans
4 slices of white or brown bread
2 tablespoons of milk (for scrambled eggs, if preferred)
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons of oil or unsalted butter

## Equipment needed:
Large frying pan or griddle
Saucepan (for beans)
Toaster or grill
Spatula
Plates and utensils

## Steps for preparation:
1. Start by heating the frying pan over medium heat. Add a bit of oil or butter.
2. Add the sausages to the pan and cook, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
3. Push the sausages to one side of the pan and add the bacon. Cook until crispy, turning once, about 3-5 minutes per side.
4. Add the black pudding slices to the pan, cooking for about 2-3 minutes on each side.
5. In the same pan, add the mushrooms and tomatoes, cut side down. Cook for about 5 minutes until the tomatoes are softened and mushrooms are browned.
6. In a separate saucepan, heat the baked beans over low heat, stirring occasionally.
7. Fry or scramble the eggs in the frying pan to your liking.
8. Toast the bread slices.
9. Serve everything hot on plates: sausages, bacon, black pudding, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, baked beans, and toast.




### Notes:

You can also include hash browns or fried bread if desired.
Adjust the quantities based on personal preference or number of servings required.
Traditional English Breakfast is hearty, so it's typically served with a hot cup of tea or coffee.
For a lighter version, you can grill the tomatoes, mushrooms, sausages, and bacon instead of frying.
